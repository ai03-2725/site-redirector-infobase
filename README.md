# Site Redirector

A utility astro site built to facilitate the decommisioning/migrating of full sites/domains/subdomains.  
Based on the redirects data in `src/data/redirects.js`, generates both a `_redirects` file for static host permanent redirects as well as a fallback redirecting page per path.
